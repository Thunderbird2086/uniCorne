# uniCorne

uniCorne is inspired by [corne](foostatn/crkbd), and it supports promicro-ish controller such as [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-nano/),
[elite-pi](https://docs.keeb.io/elite-pi-guide) and [Ble Micro Pro](https://sekigon-gonnoc.github.io/BLE-Micro-Pro/#/).
It supports hardware handedness for promicro-ish RP2040 controller boards.  Also, it is designed to support [nice!view](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-view/) without modifying board.
