# uniCorne

uniCorne is inspired by [corne](foostatn/crkbd), and here are the key features of uniCorne:

1. **Controller Compatibility**: uniCorne is specifically tailored to work with ProMicro-like controllers such as [Nice!Nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-nano/), [Elite-Pi](https://docs.keeb.io/elite-pi-guide), and [Ble Micro Pro](https://sekigon-gonnoc.github.io/BLE-Micro-Pro/#/). This ensures seamless integration and optimal performance.
1. **Hardware Handedness**: Unlike many other keyboards, uniCorne supports hardware handedness for ProMicro-like RP2040 controller boards. This flexibility allows users to choose their preferred orientation without sacrificing functionality.
1. **Nice!View Integration**: uniCorne has been meticulously crafted to seamlessly integrate with [Nice!View](https://nicekeyboards.com/docs/nice-view/). Users can enjoy a cohesive experience without needing any modifications to the board.

In summary, uniCorne combines controller compatibility, hardware flexibility, and thoughtful integration, making it a standout choice for keyboard enthusiasts.
